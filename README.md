# FPGA Index Accelerator
This project is intended as a guide for developers which want to start on FPGA programming but they don't have solid electronics background. It also houses an study and implementation of an FPGA accelerated approximate search engine for permutant-based indices on metric spaces, intended to be used as my degree project.

## Repository structure
* **memoria**: This folder houses all documentation related to my degree project document. 
* **experiment_log**: All experiments performed during the process will be documented here. Both source code and experiment log.
* **source**: Source code of the degree project studied
* **dist**: Extra repositories and resources used
* **tools**: Tools that I developed to ease my work

## Where to start?
I suggest you to read my memoria before digging all the experiments, this will give you a good insight about what's happening in them in order to allow you to build new accelerators

## Hardware used
* Adapteva Parallella

## Software required
* Xilinix Vivado 2017.2
* Xilinix Vivado HLS 2017.2
* Some C compiler like GNU GCC
* LaTex (if you want to edit some documents)
