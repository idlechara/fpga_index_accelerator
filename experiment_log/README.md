# Experiment Log
This folder houses most experiments performed.

## bitstreams
This folder houses FPGA bitstreams to load custom IP cores created through this research.

## DMA_Sources
This folder houses the DMA core that later will be part of our kernel module to control the FPGA cores.

# MetricHashing
Part of a previous research made long ago, which some changes to its build chain to work on newer versions of Intel and ARM processors.

# permutant_index_vX
Implementations of pure C permutant-based indices to be used on ARM processors, namely the Parallella.

# sigma_core
Vivado SDK and HLS codes to create custom IP cores.
